## I wanted to create something using jQuery, to see if I was ready to show off what I have learned. It took me a couple tries to eventually get the hang of it, and I may still struggle with some parts of the proccess but I'm more comfortable with how it works. It solved the problem of me not knowing how to research and not knowing the difference between JavaScript and jQuery, I did mix up the two at some point and was using both at the same time. 

## In order to view my project you will need to click on the link below and it should take you to the repo or the live website.

## The way one can use this project is you can add some events that you have planned and it will show up on the planner with the date and time.

## AskBCS did come in handy when I was stuck on a question in the middle of the night, they helped me by first cloning the repo, something was not working for me and they eventually hoped on zoom and helped me. I looked at some websites online as well I will list the link below. The one thing I used the most was looking back at class activitys and having a better understanding of what I was doing. 
https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/calendar-time - this helped me to add the date.
